Here are the differences, frame by frame:

DATA

No change between SPDY 2 and SPDY 3.


SYN_STREAM

- SPDY 2: two bit Priority field with 14 bits of unused space

- SPDY 3:

  - Priority is 3 bits instead of 2

  - new 8-bit Slot field occupies bottom byte of what was unused space

There are also changes in header blocks. See the section on that.

SYN_REPLY

- in SPDY 2, there are 16 bits of unused space between the Stream-ID
  field and the header block. This unused space is gone in SPDY 3

RST_STREAM

This frame is the same, except that there are more flags in SPDY
3. The new flags are STREAM_IN_USE, STREAM_ALREADY_CLOSED,
INVALID_CREDENTIALS, and FRAME_TOO_LARGE, that is, flag bits 8 through
11.

SETTINGS

The shape of the frame is the same, but in the ID-value pairs, the
order of the flags and the ID are reversed:

- in SPDY 2, the 24 bits of the ID come first, followed by 8 bits of
  flags

- in SPDY 3, the 8 bits of flags come first, followed by the 24 bits
  of the ID

- in SPDY 3, there is one more setting,
  SETTINGS_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_VECTOR_SIZE (value 8)

NOOP

This frame was removed in SPDY 3.

PING

This frame is unchanged.

GOAWAY

- in SPDY 2, this frame contains just the last good stream ID

- in SPDY 3, this frame contains a last good stream ID and a 32-bit
  status code

HEADERS

- in SPDY 2, there is 16 bits of unused space between the stream ID
  and the header block

- in SPDY 3, this unused space is gone, removed entirely from the
  frame

WINDOW_UPDATE

- in SPDY 2, this frame was originally part of the spec, but the
  official version 2 spec says that the frame was never implemented
  (i.e. flow control is not part of draft 2 of the spec). Effectively,
  this frame is not present in SPDY 2.

CREDENTIAL

- this frame is not present in SPDY 2


Changes in the header block
---------------------------

The number of header pairs, and the lengths of header names and header
values, were 16-bit unsigned integers in SPDY 2. They are 32-bit
unsigned integers in SPDY 3.

SPDY 3 says that names must be in the US-ASCII character encoding; it
says nothing about values except that a value may not contain the zero
byte, since it is used as a separator between distinct strings. SPDY 2
says that all strings should be utf8 encoded and should not contain a
zero byte.

Changes in header compression
-----------------------------

The prescribed compression dictionary is (very) different between SPDY
2 and SPDY 3.

Changes in HTTP layering
------------------------

In SPDY 2, the special header names associated with a request are
'method', 'scheme', 'url', and 'version'. In SPDY 3, the headers are
':method', ':path', ':version', ':host', ':scheme'. The ':path' header
holds the absolute url path for the request, the same as the
(misnamed) 'url' header in SPDY 2. Note that all the header names in
SPDY 3 are prefixed with colons, which are not legal in HTTP
headers. This is intended to prevent name clashes.

For responses, the required special headers were called 'status' and
'version' in SPDY 2. They are called ':status' and ':version' in SPDY
3.
